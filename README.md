# Welcomer
Welcomer is a configerable plugin that sends a welcome message to players that join your server!

## Setup
Setup is as simple as downloading the plugin and putting it into your `plugins` folder.

## Configuration
After installing the plugin and running the server go to `plugins/Welcomer` in your server. In there you'll see a file called `config.yml`

```
# The message that will be sent to players when they join.
# Use %player% to insert the player's name.
welcome-message: "\u00a7bWelcome to Hunger Games, %player%!"
```

simply edit `welcome-message:` to a message of your liking!
